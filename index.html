  <h1>Using Promise.all()</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What if we’re dealing with multiple promises, but we don’t care about the
      order?
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Let’s think in terms of cleaning again.</em> For us to consider our
      house clean, we need our clothes to dry, our trash bins emptied, and the
      dishwasher to run.
    </li>
    <li>
      We need all of these tasks to complete but not in any particular order.
      Furthermore, since they’re all getting done asynchronously, they should
      really all be happening at the same time!
    </li>
    <li>
      To maximize efficiency we should use <code><em>concurrency</em></code
      >, multiple asynchronous operations happening together. With promises, we
      can do this with the function
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">Promise.all()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">Promise.all()</code> accepts an
      array of promises as its argument and returns a single promise. That
      single promise will settle in one of two ways:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If every promise in the argument array resolves, the single promise
          returned from
          <code style="background-color: lightgray">Promise.all()</code> will
          resolve with an array containing the resolve value from each promise
          in the argument array.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any promise from the argument array rejects, the single promise
          returned from
          <code style="background-color: lightgray">Promise.all()</code> will
          immediately reject with the reason that promise rejected. This
          behavior is sometimes referred to as <em>failing fast</em>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
